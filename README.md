# now_and_next

_Status: in development_

For executives with executive dysfunction / ADHD etc., who are using windows and Outlook.

I'm undiagnosed, but this chimes: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0#t=4m30s]

Now that I've pu9t everything in my calendar, the problem is getting my head out of my current work to go look at the calendar and notice the next meeting coming.

This program's a crutch for that: An always-on-top timer display until your next Outlook appointment along with a summary of what Outlook meeting(s) are currently ongoing and what meeting is next.

To use it, start outlook, then start this program.  Don't minimize it :-)
